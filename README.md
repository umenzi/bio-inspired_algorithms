# Bio-Inspired Navigation for MultiAgent Systems in Extreme Environments

This repository presents a modular, easy-to-use framework for the simulation and analysis
of Bio-Inspired algorithms for the navigation of multi-agent systems in extreme environments.

## Prerequisites

This project requires a set of the following Python packages that can be installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started

There are multiple components in this project, each with its own default implementation:

- The default environment, `Environment.py`, is a 2D grid with obstacles and a starting and final position.
  - Special relevance for the  `visualize_environment` method, which plots the environment and the path found by the
    algorithm, if any.
    - The user can generate as many types of obstacles as desired by providing an array of the obstacles' radius
      and their frequencies. The obstacles are then generated randomly in the inner 80% of the environment.
- The agents, `Agent.py`.
- The algorithms are stored in the `algorithms` folder.
- Additional helper classes, such as `Coordinate.py` or `Direction.py`, are also provided in the `helpers` folder.


### Swarm algorithms

The following are the algorithms currently implemented:
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [4].
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).
- Adaptive dynamic probabilistic elitist ACO (ADPE ACO) [2].
- Adaptive Firefly Algorithm (AFFA) [1, 3].

When adding new algorithms, make sure to extend each of these classes with your own implementation.
You may also need to extend the default environment, as in the case of the ACO algorithm.
PSO, for example, does not require any changes.

A detailed example of several Bio-Inspired algorithms is given in `Main.ipynb`.

## Evaluation

The framework includes a simple evaluation of the algorithms, where we compare their performance based on:
- Path length.
- Reachability.
- Planning.

We evaluate the performance of algorithms for different obstacle densities, with each density level being tested in four
distinct, randomly generated environments. Subsequently, 20 individual experiments are conducted for each
obstacle-environment combination. We then compute the mean of the metrics from these 80 experiments, 
which provides a robust and reliable basis for the comparison.

The code can be found in the `evaluation` folder.
We also perform some hyperparameter tuning, using the [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) library.
